## Abstract

This paper investigates the integration of agentic AI with multimodal foundation models to advance autonomous driving[cite: 2]. Agentic AI systems, distinguished by their proactive decision-making and adaptive reasoning, are combined with multimodal foundation models capable of processing and fusing diverse sensor inputs including vision, LiDAR, and radar to achieve comprehensive environmental understanding[cite: 3]. This synergy enhances core autonomous driving functions such as perception, prediction, and planning, enabling vehicles to navigate complex, real-world environments with minimal human intervention[cite: 4]. We highlight recent progress in multimodal data integration, discuss sophisticated decision-making frameworks, and explore strategies to ensure robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios[cite: 5]. Additionally, we examine emerging challenges, address safety and reliability considerations, and propose directions for future research and development[cite: 6]. By unifying agentic intelligence with multimodal foundation models, this work provides a blueprint for more reliable, adaptable, and ultimately safer autonomous driving systems[cite: 7].
